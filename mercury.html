                <p>
                Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the sun in the Solar System. 
                Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System
                </p>

                <p>
                Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance,[16] meaning that relative to the fixed stars,
                it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about ​1⁄30 degree). 
                Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;
                at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion.
                </p>
